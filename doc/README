Primary features

The example 'member_of_role', 'member_of_role_by_user_id' and 'member_of_role_by_user' template operators provided


Summary

Example 'member_of_role' template operator autoload configuration file (required) and OWSimpleOperator based 'BCMemberOfRoleByUserIDOperator' class and method 'member_of_role' (required).

Provided class methods 'member_of_role', 'member_of_role_by_user_id' and 'member_of_role_by_user' (template operators) accept and requires two parameters.

The methods above require both UserID (integer, contentobject_id) / User (ezuser class object) and RoleID parameters.

The base method fetches the user, user roles, iterates over user roles and compares RoleID param till it finds a match and returns true, false if no match is found / etc.

This code can also be used statically within custom PHP code without making any changes. Remember to clear cache and regenerate autoloads!

OWSimpleOperator extension makes available a simple to define PHP template operators.

Example files above provide the 'member_of_role' template operator autoload configuration file (required) and OWSimpleOperator based 'BCMemberOfRoleByUserIDOperator' class and method 'member_of_role' (also required).

Provided class method 'member_of_role' and 'member_of_role_by_user_id' (template operators) accepts and requires two parameters: UserID and RoleID (Both required).
